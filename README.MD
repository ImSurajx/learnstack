# 📘 learnstack

A personal log of my full-stack web development journey, based on the [Web Development Masterclass - Complete Certificate Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-dev-master/). This repository documents my daily learnings, code samples, and hands-on practice as I work through each section of the course.

## 🚀 About

This repository serves as my digital learning journal while I build skills in full-stack web development. Each commit represents a new concept, feature, or project I’ve explored—from basic HTML tables to full backend integrations.

Whether it's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, or databases—it's all documented here in a clean and organized structure.

## Project Status Update

**Currently, this repository (`learnstack`) is not under active development.**

The self-learning efforts on this project have been paused to allow for dedicated focus on the 

**Sheryians Coding School 2.0 Job Ready AI Powered Cohort: Web + DSA + Aptitude** course.

This structured learning program includes comprehensive full-stack web development, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and AI integration, and the aim is to leverage this formal education for career readiness.

This project may be revisited and continued in the future.
